 # Video-Web-App
-Web Application for converting Videos
+
+A full-stack web application for uploading, transcoding, and streaming video content. The backend exposes a REST API for authentication, upload management, and media streaming, while the client provides an intuitive interface for creators and viewers. This guide walks through local development setup and everyday workflows.

+## Prerequisites
+Ensure the following software is installed before working with the project:
+
+| Tool | Version | Notes |
+| ---- | ------- | ----- |
+| Node.js | **18.x** or higher | Required for both server and client builds. Install via [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or the official installer.
+| npm | Bundled with Node.js | `npm -v` should report at least 8.x.
+| FFmpeg | Latest stable | Used for generating thumbnails and video transcodes. Confirm with `ffmpeg -version`.
+| Git | Latest | Required to clone and manage repository changes.
+| Database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite) | Local instance | The app uses the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable; PostgreSQL is assumed in the examples below.

+```
+
+> **Note:** If the `storage/uploads` or `storage/transcoded` directories are missing locally, create them before running the server to avoid runtime errors.
+
+## Installation
+Clone the repository and install dependencies for both the server and client.
+
+```bash
+# Clone and enter the repository
+git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/Video-Web-App.git
+cd Video-Web-App
+```
+
+### Server Setup
+1. Navigate into the server workspace and install dependencies:
+   ```bash
+   cd server
+   npm install
+   ```
+2. Duplicate the provided `.env.example` (or create a new `.env` file using the template in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section).
+3. Generate Prisma types (if Prisma is used):
+   ```bash
+   npx prisma generate
+   ```
+4. Start the development server with hot reload:
+   ```bash
+   npm run dev
+   ```
+   The API will default to `http://localhost:4000`.
+
+> For production builds, run `npm run build` followed by `npm start`.
+
+### Client Setup
+1. In a new terminal window, install the client dependencies:
+   ```bash
+   cd client
+   npm install
+   ```
+2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` or create one using the template below.
+3. Start the Vite dev server:
+   ```bash
+   npm run dev
+   ```
+4. Open the printed URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`) to use the UI.
+
+## Environment Variables
+### Server `.env`
+```env
+NODE_ENV=development
+PORT=4000
+CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
+DATABASE_URL=postgresql://video_user:video_password@localhost:5432/video_app
+JWT_SECRET=replace-with-a-secure-random-string
+UPLOAD_DIR=storage/uploads
+TRANSCODED_DIR=storage/transcoded
+FFMPEG_PATH=/usr/bin/ffmpeg
+MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB=500
+```
+
+- `CLIENT_URL` controls allowed origins for CORS.
+- `FFMPEG_PATH` overrides the ffmpeg binary path if it is not on your `PATH`.
+- `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB` protects the server from unexpectedly large uploads.
+
+### Client `.env`
+```env
+VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
+VITE_STREAMING_URL=http://localhost:4000/stream
+VITE_CHUNK_SIZE_MB=5
+```
+
+- Restart both apps after modifying environment values.
+- For production builds, use fully qualified HTTPS URLs for the server endpoints.
+
+## Initialize the Database
+The server relies on a relational database. Use Prisma (or the ORM configured for the project) to create schema and seed base data.
+
+```bash
+# From the project root
+cd server
+
+# Create and apply migrations
+npx prisma migrate dev --name init
+
+# Seed initial data (admin account, demo content, etc.)
+npx prisma db seed
+```
+
+If you already have migrations in place, run `npx prisma migrate deploy` instead of `migrate dev` to simply apply them.
+
+## Using the Application
+Start both the server (`npm run dev` inside `server`) and the client (`npm run dev` inside `client`). Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
+
+### Register and Log In
+1. Click **Sign Up** to create a new account. Fill out the name, email, and password fields, then submit the form.
+2. The client posts to `POST /auth/register`. A success response automatically logs you in or directs you to the sign-in page.
+3. Existing users can log in from the **Sign In** page. Credentials are sent to `POST /auth/login`, which responds with a JWT stored in secure cookies/local storage for authenticated requests.
+4. Use the profile dropdown to confirm your session or to log out.
+
+### Upload and Transcode Videos
+1. After logging in, open the **Upload** page.
+2. Choose a video file (`.mp4`, `.mov`, `.mkv`, etc.). The client uploads the file via `POST /videos` using multipart form data.
+3. The server stores the raw file inside `storage/uploads` and immediately enqueues a transcoding job.
+4. Background workers call FFmpeg to create adaptive bitrate outputs (HLS playlists and segmented `.ts` files) inside `storage/transcoded/<videoId>/`.
+5. Progress updates are surfaced through WebSocket or polling endpoints (`GET /videos/:id/status`). The UI displays status badges such as *Queued*, *Processing*, *Ready*, or *Failed*.
+
+### Stream Videos
+1. Navigate to the **Library** or **My Videos** section.
+2. Select a processed video. The player requests the HLS manifest via `GET /stream/:videoId/master.m3u8`.
+3. Playback uses the HTML5 `<video>` element with `hls.js` for adaptive streaming.
+4. Download options (if enabled) hit `GET /videos/:id/download` to retrieve MP4 renditions from the `transcoded` directory.
+
+### File Storage Locations
+- **Raw uploads:** `storage/uploads/<videoId>/<originalFilename>`
+- **Transcoded assets:** `storage/transcoded/<videoId>/{master.m3u8, 360p.m3u8, ...}`
+- **Temporary thumbnails:** `storage/transcoded/<videoId>/thumb.jpg`
+
+Ensure the `storage` directory is writable by the Node.js process. In production, consider using an object storage provider (S3, GCS) by swapping the storage driver in your server configuration.
+
+## Troubleshooting
+### FFmpeg is not available
+- Confirm installation by running `ffmpeg -version`. If the command fails, install FFmpeg via `brew install ffmpeg` (macOS), `apt install ffmpeg` (Ubuntu/Debian), or download the static builds for Windows.
+- If FFmpeg is installed but the server cannot find it, set the absolute path in `FFMPEG_PATH` and restart the server.
+- Verify the Node.js process has execution permissions for the binary (`chmod +x $(which ffmpeg)`).
+
+### CORS errors
+- Browser console errors such as `CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header` indicate a mismatch between the client origin and `CLIENT_URL`.
+- Ensure `CLIENT_URL` in the server `.env` exactly matches the protocol, host, and port of your client.
+- When serving the client from a different domain in production, add it to the server's CORS whitelist and redeploy.
+
+### Upload file too large
+- The server enforces upload limits via `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB`. Increase this value cautiously in the server `.env` and restart the process.
+- Reverse proxies (nginx, Traefik) may impose additional limits. Set `client_max_body_size` (nginx) or equivalent to match the server limit.
+- Check available disk space in `storage/uploads`; transcoding requires temporary disk space roughly equal to 2–3x the original file size.
+
+With these steps and troubleshooting tips, you should be able to configure, run, and extend the Video Web App in your local environment.
